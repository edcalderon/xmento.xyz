# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Xmento Vault project.

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Used for deploying contracts. Never commit this to version control.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: The address with administrative privileges.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS`: The factory contract address.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Required for WalletConnect integration.

### Local Development
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in the required values
3. Never commit `.env.local` to version control

### Production
- Use environment-specific files (`.env.production`, `.env.staging`, etc.)
- Store secrets in a secure secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
- Never hardcode secrets in the application code

## Private Keys and Mnemonics

- Never commit private keys or mnemonics to version control
- Use environment variables for private keys in development
- In production, use a secure key management system
- Rotate keys regularly and revoke unused keys

## Smart Contract Security

- Always verify contracts on block explorers
- Use OpenZeppelin's well-audited contracts when possible
- Test contracts thoroughly on testnets before deploying to mainnet
- Consider getting a professional security audit for production contracts

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to security@xmento.xyz. We appreciate your help in keeping Xmento Vault secure.

## Secure Development

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerable dependencies
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper access controls in smart contracts
- Use reentrancy guards where appropriate

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Rotate all exposed keys immediately
2. Investigate the root cause
3. Deploy fixes
4. Communicate transparently with users if their funds or data are at risk
